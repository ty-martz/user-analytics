## Exploratory data analysis of user behavior:
For this project, you could take a dataset of user behavior on a website or mobile app, and conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into how users interact with the platform. Some questions you might explore include:

- What are the most common actions users take on the platform?
- How long do users typically spend on the platform, and how frequently do they visit?
- Are there certain types of users who are more engaged with the platform than others?
- Are there any patterns or trends in user behavior over time?
- 
#### Here are some example datasets you could use for this project:

- The Online Retail dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: 
  - This dataset contains transaction data from an online retailer, including information on customer ID, product description, quantity purchased, and price. You could use this data to explore how customers interact with the retailer's website, what types of products are most popular, and how purchase behavior varies over time.
- The Yelp Dataset from Kaggle:
  - This dataset contains information on user reviews and ratings of businesses on the Yelp platform. You could use this data to explore how users rate businesses, what types of businesses are most popular, and how ratings and review behavior vary by location or category.

## Predictive modeling for customer churn:
For this project, you could take a dataset of customer behavior for a subscription-based service, and build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (i.e., cancel their subscription). Some questions you might explore include:

- What factors are most predictive of customer churn?
- How accurate is your model at identifying customers who are likely to churn?
- What strategies could the company use to reduce customer churn based on your model's predictions?

#### Here are some example datasets you could use for this project:

- The Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle:
  - This dataset contains information on customer behavior for a telecommunications company, including demographics, usage data, and churn status. You could use this data to build a model to predict which customers are likely to churn, and explore what factors are most predictive of churn.
- The Online Retail dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (mentioned above):
  - This dataset also contains information on customer behavior, including information on customer ID, purchase behavior, and demographic information. You could use this data to build a model to predict which customers are likely to churn, and explore how purchase behavior and demographics are related to churn likelihood.

## Content and Music Analysis
Analyze the Spotify content and music library to identify trends and insights that could inform future content creation and music licensing decisions.

### Data: 
- Spotify content and music library metadata, workout metrics, member engagement data from their API

### Questions to answer:
- What are the most popular music genres and artists?
- Are there any patterns in member engagement based on the type of workout or music used?
- Can we identify any trends in member behavior or preferences over time?

### Skills to demonstrate:
- Data cleaning and manipulation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization
- Machine learning (optional)
